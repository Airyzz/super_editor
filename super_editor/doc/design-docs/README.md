# Super Editor Design
The mission of Super Editor is to provide the Flutter community with a document editing toolkit that can be used to effectively compose any and every desired document editing experience. It's an ambitious goal, but it's worth achieving.

In service of Super Editor's mission, it's important to understand two details:

 1. Super Editor can't achieve its goal if it's opinionated about backing technologies, such as document transport formats or storage mechanisms. As a result, Super Editor only provides user interface tools.
 2. A monolith can never support all use-cases. Super Editor embraces aggressive composition so that developers can more easily compose highly custom document experiences with minimal effort.
