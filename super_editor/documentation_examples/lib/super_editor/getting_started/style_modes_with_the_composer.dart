/// Example that demonstrates how to use `SuperEditor`'s `DocumentComposer` to control style modes, such as
/// bold, italics, and strikethrough.

/// For this example, you can think of the toolbar in Microsoft Word or Google Docs with the "B" and "I" buttons
/// that toggle bold and italics on and off.
